RE.DFINED Y99 BIO is a Python application designed to automatically update your Y99 bio with the current song you're listening to. By integrating with YouTube and Last.fm APIs, this app fetches the song information and updates your bio accordingly. This README provides a comprehensive guide to set up and configure the app.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Access to Last.fm API
- A Last.fm account connected to your music service of choice. [Last.fm Help](https://www.last.fm/about/trackmymusic)

## Install Instructions

### On Windows

1. **Install Python:**
   - Download the Python 3. from the Microsoft Store.

2. **Install pip:**
   - Pip is included by default with Python installations. You can verify it by running `pip --version` in Command Prompt.

3. **Install required modules:**
   - Open Command Prompt and run:
     ```bash
     pip install flask requests aiotube
     ```

### On Linux

1. **Install Python:**
   - Use your package manager to install Python. For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
     ```

2. **Install required modules:**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     pip3 install flask requests aiotube
     ```

## Getting API Keys for Last.fm


**Last.fm API:**
   - Visit the [Last.fm API page](https://www.last.fm/api/).
   - Sign up for a Last.fm account if you don't have one.
   - Go to the "Create an API Account" section.
   - Follow the instructions to obtain your API Key.

## Filling the API Keys into `app.py`

Open the `app.py` file and locate the following lines:

```python
# API-Daten
api_key = 'LAST_FM_API_HERE'
```

# API-DATA
api_key = 'LAST_FM_API_HERE'
Replace `'LAST_FM_API_HERE'` with your Last.fm API Key.

## Getting the Session Token

1. Open the Y99 web application and press `F12` to open Developer Tools.
2. Navigate to the "Network" tab.
3. Look for a request with the name "whatsup".
4. Click on this request and go to the "Payload" tab.
5. Find the `auth` field in the payload section. The `session-token` value is what you need.

Copy this session token and ensure it is used in your application as required.

I will realease my Beta Plugin to Extract the token quickly later on.

## Usage
> [!WARNING]
> BACKUP YOUR BIO BEFOREHAND!
1. **Run the App:**
   - Open the folder in witch the app.py file is located (on windows just type cmd in the navigation bar of the folder)
   - Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

2. **Web UI:**
   - Open your Webbrowser on http://localhost:5000 or if you host it on a server http://server-ip:5000

     
3. **Monitor:**
   - The app will fetch the current song from Last.fm and update your Y99 bio accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

Have fun with your cool new Bio
